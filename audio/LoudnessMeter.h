/**
 * @class LoudnessMeter
 * @brief Integrated loudness (ITU-R BS.1770-4 / EBU R128) and sample peak of
 *        one track, fed samples as they are decoded or ripped.
 *
 * The signal is K-weighted, its mean square taken over 400 ms blocks that
 * overlap by 75 %, and the blocks gated: those below -70 LUFS are dropped,
 * then those more than 10 LU below the mean of the rest. The loudness of
 * what remains is the integrated loudness.
 *
 * ReplayGain 2.0 is derived from it: gain = -18 LUFS - loudness. Album
 * loudness gates the blocks of all the album's tracks together, so keep
 * each track's meter (or its Blocks()) until the album is done.
