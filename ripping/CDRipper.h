 * @class CDRipper
 * @brief Reads a mounted audio CD and encodes its tracks on its own thread,
 *        reporting to a messenger.
 *
 * Before ripping it looks the disc up in AccurateRip and, if the drive's read
 * offset isn't known yet, looks the drive up in AccurateRip's drive list or,
 * failing that, finds the offset by matching tracks against the database
 * (MSG_CD_RIP_OFFSET, "from_list" telling which). Every track is then read
 * shifted by that
 * offset, so the files hold exactly the audio other rippers get, and its
 * AccurateRip checksum is compared as it is written.
 *
 * Sends MSG_CD_RIP_STATUS for the lookup steps, MSG_CD_RIP_PROGRESS (at most
 * ~5 a second), MSG_CD_RIP_TRACK_DONE per track and one MSG_CD_RIP_FINISHED
 * at the end, including after Cancel().
 *
 * When the drive reports C2 errors, the disc is read straight from the drive
 * (CdDriveReader) and every track's read errors are counted, CDEx-style: a
 * sector the drive flags is re-read up to kRetries times and counts as fixed
 * if a re-read comes back clean, as damaged if not. A sector that can't be
 * read at all is filled with silence and the rip goes on. A damaged spot gets
 * kChunkTimeBudget per chunk; what is still unread then counts as unreadable,
 * so a badly scratched disc can't stall the rip for hours. Without C2 support
 * the cdda files are read as before and errors are not checked.
 *
 * Every track is also measured for ReplayGain 2.0 as it is encoded; its
 * track gain is tagged straight away, and the album gain once the whole disc
 * has been ripped in one go.
 *
 * Each track is written to "<name>.part" and renamed once complete, so a
 * cancelled or failed track never leaves a truncated file behind. A file that
 * already exists is left alone and reported as skipped (status
 * B_FILE_EXISTS), which makes re-running a partly failed rip cheap.
