/**
 * @class CdDriveReader
 * @brief Reads audio sectors straight from the drive, with the C2 error
 *        flags the drive raises for bytes it could not correct.
 *
 * Haiku's cdda file system reads with no error information, so a sector the
 * drive could not read cleanly comes back looking fine. This sends READ CD
 * (MMC 0xBE) through B_RAW_DEVICE_COMMAND on the drive's raw device instead,
 * which works while cdda keeps the disc mounted.
 *
 * Measured on HaikuBox (hp CDDVDW TS-H653R, hrev60368), and built in:
 * - One command moves at most 128 KiB; 49 sectors with C2 data still fit, 50
 *   are rejected. Reads go out in chunks of kChunkSectors.
 * - The drive flags (and returns uncorrected) the last ~3 sectors of a read it
 *   stops at: CD audio's error correction is interleaved across neighbouring
 *   sectors. Every read therefore asks for kOverlapSectors more than it keeps.
 * - It refuses reads past the last track ("LBA out of range"), so overlap is
 *   cut at the lead-out, and the disc's final sectors can't be verified.
