/**
 * @namespace AccurateRip
 * @brief Checks ripped tracks against the AccurateRip database.
 *
 * AccurateRip stores, per pressing of a disc, a checksum of every track as
 * other people ripped it and how many rips agreed ("confidence"). A rip whose
 * checksum matches is bit-identical to theirs.
 *
 * Formats follow whipper's implementation (accuraterip-checksum.c, table.py,
 * accurip.py). Beton can look rips up but not submit them: the database only
 * accepts submissions from approved rippers.
 *
 * A drive reads a fixed number of samples early or late (its read offset),
 * which shifts every checksum. ListedDriveOffset() looks it up in
 * AccurateRip's list of drives; for a drive not in it, FindOffset() works the
 * offset out from the database itself. That can mislead: a disc from a
 * pressing whose audio sits some samples off the common one matches at the
 * wrong offset, which is why the list comes first.
