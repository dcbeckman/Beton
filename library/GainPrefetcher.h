/**
 * @class GainPrefetcher
 * @brief Measures the track gain of library tracks that have none, a few at
 *        a time while music plays, so the library fills in by itself.
 *
 * The window hands it the tracks it wants measured, most wanted first (the
 * next track, then the rows on screen). One worker thread measures them below
 * normal priority and reports each result as MSG_LOUDNESS_PROGRESS, which
 * stores it in the library. When writing to files is on, the gain is also
 * written into the file's tags, but never into the file that is playing:
 * that write waits until another track plays.
